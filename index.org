* Overview of Kinvey product
** What is Kinvey
   Kinvey is a serverless development platform. It provides Backend As a Service which means that developers would not require to build and maintain a backend for their apps. 
   
   Key features:
   - user management
   - storing data in the cloud
   - file storage
   - integration with external data source
** Kinvey Console
   Kinvey Console is the web-based GUI that allows you to manage most aspects of your Kinvey backend.

* Kinvey Features
* Apps & Environments
  | Apps         | A backend app contains all components (data, authentication, server-side logic, etc.). It can be used/connected to multiple frontent apps. |
  | Environments | A backend app can have multiple environments to support the development lifecycle: Development, Staging, Production                        |
  
  Each environment has a uniqu ID calld KID (Kinvey ID) which starts with `kid_...`

** Creating a user in Node.js
   #+BEGIN_SRC js
     var request = require("request");

     var options = {
       method: "POST",
       url: "https://jci-us1-baas.kinvey.com/user/kid_HJdVi4iZS",
       headers: {Authorization: 'Basic a2lkX0hKZFZpN....'},
       body: {username: "ivan", password: "123456", city: "Boston"},
       json: true
     };

     request(options, function(error, response, body) {
       if (error) throw new Error(error);

       console.log(body);
     });
   #+END_SRC
   
** Logging a user in Node.js
  #+BEGIN_SRC js
    var request = require("request");

    var options = {
      method: "POST",
      url: "https://jci-us1-baas.kinvey.com/user/kid_HJdVi4iZS/login",
      headers: {Authorization: 'Basic a2lkX0hKZFZpNGlaU...'},
      body: { username: "ivan", password: "123456" },
      json: true
    };

    request(options, function(error, response, body) {
      if (error) throw new Error(error);

      console.log(body);
    });
  #+END_SRC 
** Important notes
    1) Passing empty body when creating a new user will result in the `username` and `password` being auto-generated.
    2) By default the issued user session tokens do not expire. You can add expiration through *Console* \to *App settings* \to *User session timeout*
* Collections
  #+ATTR_HTML: :style text-align:left
  Creating a collection
    1) Through Kinvey Console
    2) Making a POST request to a non-existing collection would create the collection first before adding a file to it
** CRUD opeartions
  Kinvey supports CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) by making a requests to the following url for collections: 
  #+BEGIN_SRC 
  URL: /appdata/:appKey/:collectionName
  #+END_SRC
  
  \\ 
  #+ATTR_HTML: :target _blank

** Differences between relatinal and NoSQL databases
   Kinvey uses MongoDB which is a NoSQL database. A NoSQL databse stores data as key-value pairs. 
      
   #+BEGIN_SRC json
     {
       "_id": ObjectId("5099803df3f4948bd2f98391"),
       "name": { "first": "Alan", "last": "Turing" },
       "city": "Boston",
       "contribs": ["Turing machine", "Turing test", "Turingery"],
       "views":125
     }
   #+END_SRC
   
   #+BEGIN_VERSE
   Kinvey uses MongoDB which is a NoSQL database. A NoSQL databse stores data as key-value pairs. 
   NoSQL database has no schema (like relational).
   NoSQL does not require *Normalized Data*. There are even benefits when using *Denormalized data*.

* Files
 #+ATTR_HTML: :style text-align:left
 *Uploading files*
 Kinvey stores files in a third-party service - currently Google Cloud Storage. \\
 Uploading to Kinvey is a two-step process:
 1) Upload file metadata to Kinvey
 2) Upload file data to Google Cloud storage
\\ 
\\
  #+ATTR_HTML: :target _blank 
  Docs - https://devcenter.kinvey.com/rest/guides/files
** Upload metadata important notes
1) File content type: Note that you would set an "X-Kinvey-Content-Type" header if you want to set the content type to Google Cloud Storage.
2) Public/Private files:
   - When uploading the file as *public: true*, in the first request's response you would receive not only the *_uploadURL* but also *_requiredHeaders* which should be included in the second request as headers.
   - When uploading the file as *public:false*, the response would return an empty *_requiredHeaders* property, so NO additional headers should be included in the second request, otherwise it would result in an error response.
** Upload file sample request
   *Upload file metadata*
   #+BEGIN_SRC
   POST /blob/:appKey HTTP/1.1
   Content-Type: application/json
   X-Kinvey-Content-Type: image/png
   Authorization: [user credentials]
​
  {
     "_filename": "some-file-name",
     "_public": true
  }
   #+END_SRC
   
   *Upload file data*
   #+BEGIN_SRC 
   PUT _uploadURL
   Content-Type: image/png
   _requiredHeaders // ONLY if received by previous call
​
   Body:
   binary file here
   #+END_SRC
* Services
  #+BEGIN_VERSE
  Services are objects that can be shared between Environemnts in an App or between Apps in an Organization.
  Services include:
  #+END_VERSE
  
  - *Mobile Identity Connect* (MIC) - bridges mobile applications with existing enterprise identity and single sign-on solutions
  - *Flex* - low-code, lightweight Node.js microservices for adding server-side code
  - *RAPID* - connect to existing enterprise external data (like relational Database or external REST API)
* Serverside Code
  Serverside code is mainly used to create logic that is executed as a *collection hook* (before or after a request to a collection is made) or to a *custom endpiont* - a logic that has its own endpiont to be called and be executed.
[[./images/kinvey_request.png]] 
 
  - Business Logic - writing server side logic (collection hooks and custom endpints) right inside Kinvey Console. It is preferable to use Flex instead of Business Logic.
  - Flex - create a Node.js microservice that you can deploy to Kinvey.
  - Scheduled code - execute custom endpionts on predefined intervals
* Flex
  Kinvey Flex is a more feature-rich and flexible way to write server-side code for your apps compared to Business Logic. \\
  Flex has three flavors: data integration services, authentication services, and general-purpose functions.
  
  \\
  Prerequisites:  
  1) install NPM (Node Package Manager)
  2) install Kinvey CLI - https://github.com/Kinvey/kinvey-cli
     
  \\
  #+ATTR_HTML: :target _blank

** Create Flex Service in Kinvey Console
   Before you can deploy your Node.js project, you need to provision a Flex service using the Kinvey Console.
   \\

   Docs - https://devcenter.kinvey.com/rest/guides/flexservice-runtime#creating-an-internal-flex-service
** Initialize a Node.js project
  #+BEGIN_SRC shell
    mkdir 'myProject'
    cd 'myProject'
    npm init
    npm install kinvey-flex-sdk
    touch index.js
  #+END_SRC 
** Initialize the Flex SDK inside index.js
  #+REVEAL_HTML: <div style="font-size: 80%;">
  #+BEGIN_SRC js
    const sdk = require("kinvey-flex-sdk");

    sdk.service({}, function(err, flex) {
      if (err) {
        console.log(err);
      }

      console.log(`===> Flex Service started (SDK v${flex.version})`);

      // Define a function to execute
      function logTime(context, complete, modules) {
        console.log(new Date());
        complete()
          .ok()
          .done();
      }
      // Register the logTime function as a Flex function
      flex.functions.register("logTime", logTime);
    });
  #+END_SRC
